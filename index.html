        <p>Are you a fan of Star Wars franchise? Did you know that Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from his normal syntax! Because of this it is difficult to accurately represent his sentence structure. Use the translator to convert your text from English to Yoda speak or Yodish language.<br><strong>Have fun and may the force be with you!</strong></p>
